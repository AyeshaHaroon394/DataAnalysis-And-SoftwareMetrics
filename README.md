1 - Plot histograms for each dataset (including 1, 2, 3) and for each component/module in dataset 3 to know the distribution of minor, major, critical bugs etc. Sheets A, C, D, W in dataset 3 show the records component wise, whereas the first sheet contains the records of all the components. 
2 - For dataset 3, plot pareto charts to know which modules have been reported to have the most number of bugs
3 - Find the value of percent delinquent fixes (pdf) in datasets 2 and 3. A fix should be closed within 4 hours of reporting. Find it month wise. 
4 - Plot a time run chart for the pdf calculated in 3
5 - Plot control chart for the pdf in 3 where upper and lower control limits are (mean + 2SD) and (Mean - 2SD) respectively. Highlight the points where the values are out of the limits

6 - Find Schedule estimation accuracy for the bugs in dataset 2
7 - Find fix response time (Page 107 of Kan's book) for dataset 2 and 3. For dataset 3, also give module wise values of the fix response time
8 - For dataset 2 and 3 Plot the value of BMI month wise
9 - Give pareto diagram to know which assignee has been given most of the bugs to resolve in dataset 3
10 - Give pareto diagram to know which assignee has been given most of the bugs to resolve and they are still not closed in dataset 3
11 - Let column B in dataset 3 be the customer reported problems. Let bugs be the actual defects and rest to be the other customer problems. Find the proportion and percentage of actual defects from all the reported problems. Do it for the whole dataset as well as module wise.
